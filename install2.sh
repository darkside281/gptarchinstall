# Wipe the target disk and create partitions
# WARNING: This will delete all data on the specified disk. Make sure you've backed up your data.
# You may use tools like parted, fdisk, or cfdisk for partitioning. Example:
# parted -s "$target_disk" mklabel gpt
# parted -s "$target_disk" mkpart primary ext4 1MiB 100%

# Format partitions and mount the root partition
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX1 # Replace sdX1 with the correct partition
# mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt # Replace sdX1 and /mnt with the correct partition and mount point

# Install essential packages and base system
# pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware

# Generate fstab file
# genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

# Change root into the new system
# arch-chroot /mnt

# Set the time zone
# ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Your_Region/Your_City /etc/localtime
# hwclock --systohc

# Uncomment the desired locale in /etc/locale.gen
# Generate the locale
# locale-gen

# Set the system language
# echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf

# Set the hostname
# echo "your_desired_hostname" > /etc/hostname

# Add matching entries to /etc/hosts
# Example: 127.0.0.1 localhost
#          ::1       localhost
#          127.0.1.1 your_desired_hostname.localdomain your_desired_hostname

# Install and configure network manager
# pacman -S networkmanager
# systemctl enable NetworkManager

# Install bootloader (GRUB)
# pacman -S grub
# grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdX # Replace sdX with the disk (not the partition)
# grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

# Create a user with sudo access
# useradd -m -G wheel "$username"
# echo "$username:$password" | chpasswd

# Configure sudo
# Uncomment the %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL line in /etc/sudoers to allow members of the wheel group to use sudo

# Install and configure the desktop environment
# The packages and configuration will depend on the chosen desktop environment (GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.)

# Enable and start the display manager (e.g., GDM for GNOME, SDDM for KDE)
# systemctl enable gdm # Replace gdm with the appropriate display manager

# Exit the chroot environment and unmount partitions
# exit
# umount -R /mnt
